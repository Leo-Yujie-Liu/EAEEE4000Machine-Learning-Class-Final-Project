# EAEEE4000Machine-Learning-Class-Final-Project
The content includes the code and data involved in the final project of the deep learning course by Yujie Liu (yl5578) Columbia University in the city of Newyork

A few.m files are functions used to bridge matlab and python file formats using matlab to preprocess data and visualize prediction results
matlab is used for data preprocessing, and in the LSTM_DataPrepared.mlx file Draw_Y_test.mlx is used later for visual analysis

The x training data was too big, so I uploaded it via google drive. Here's the link to the data:

Various npy files in the folder, the number represents the selected timelag, and log Nor detrend respectively indicates that this set of data has been log, standardized and detrend processing
